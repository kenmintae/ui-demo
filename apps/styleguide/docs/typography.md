Standardized typography helps us reduce the number of distinct styles and enhance consistency across our products.

#### Headings<a name="headings"></a>

Headings serve as titles for pages and sections. The [Heading](#!/Heading) component conveniently includes styles for each level of heading.

```jsx noeditor
<TypographyGuide group="headings" sample="Heading" />
```

#### Paragraphs<a name="paragraphs"></a>

Blocks of text (each one or more sentences) that are visually separated from adjacent blocks by vertical blank space. Error messages also typically use a paragraph format.

The [TextBlock](#!/TextBlock) component, which defaults to `paragraphs.m`, is typically what we use for paragraph text.

```jsx noeditor
<TypographyGuide group="paragraphs" sample="Fusce vehicula dolor arcu, sit amet blandit dolor mollis nec." />
```

#### Controls<a name="controls"></a>

We classify interactive pieces of text, such as buttons, inputs and labels, as control text.

```jsx noeditor
<TypographyGuide group="controls" sample="Control" />
```

#### Body Text Format

When formatting your text and copy into longer forms like documentation or articles, you can make your text more scannable by using these tools:

```jsx
// loadExample('./typographyFormatting')
```
