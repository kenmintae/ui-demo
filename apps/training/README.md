# z-frontend-training

We have developed a hands-on workshop to help you get up to speed with the new UI platform.

This app is a skeleton intended to be developed during the workshop. [View workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bmddOYh7JnQgZ1js9ScRfYrv0Xp69JLh_vH2-eJKvOM/)

The slides are designed to be self-service, but we're here to help! Feel free to reach out anytime with questions
on the #dev-ui-react Slack channel or otherwise.

See the [z-frontend readme](https://github.com/zenefits/z-frontend#work-with-z-frontend) for basic environment
setup and pre-requisites.
