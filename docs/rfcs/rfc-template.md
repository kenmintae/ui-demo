# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature or proposal.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with UI at Zenefits to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# How We Teach This

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing patterns, or as a
wholly new one?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the UIE documentation must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how we teach to new users
at any level?

How should this feature be introduced and taught to current developers?

# Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider the impact on teaching,
on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
