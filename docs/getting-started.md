The Zenefits Design System is the foundation for our products. It exists to make designing and developing
products more efficient with baked in consistency.

This website is a living product based on what is implemented in our UI platform. It covers foundational
attributes as well as reusable components based upon those attributes.

We welcome feedback! You can post on the _#user-experience_ or _#dev-ui-react_ Slack
channels or [report an issue](https://github.com/zenefits/z-frontend/issues/) directly.

#### Design

The mocks for our design system live in a [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/WUXFnK6Sfzc9x3ZTcpABbFac/Zenebitz).
Each week, a cross-functional team of designers and developers meet to review design proposals and gather consensus on
guidelines. [Learn more about our process](#!/Design%20System%20Proposals).

#### Development

Consult this site often. It is automatically updated whenever we merge a PR related to the UI platform.

The [z-frontend repo README](https://github.com/zenefits/z-frontend/blob/master/README.md) explains how to setup your
local environment. There's also [training available](https://github.com/zenefits/z-frontend/tree/master/apps/training)
for learning React, GraphQL and Typescript as used at Zenefits.
