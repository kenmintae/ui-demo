#### Finding Our Voice

Zenefits is a trustworthy and dependable source of insight into building a company with culture. As leaders in the
people business, we speak in a personable tone that's warm and attentive. While that tone may shift as any situation
changes, we are always a reliable and optimistic voice despite the complexities of the new world of work.

Simply put, we are our best selves and our best Zenefits when we empathize with our customers. Speaking through careful
rhythm and cadence, we offer answers that resist jargon and drive straight to the point. These interactions working
across the customer experience lay a foundation of trust with businesses of all shapes and sizes. We build on that
trust with our open honesty around complex topics, reminding customers why they rely on Zenefits.

While we don’t express an opinion on the regulations that guide us, we understand the urgency and impact employers and
employees face. We keep them informed by focusing on the benefits and positives so they can focus on their business and
staff. Keep the voice humble, friendly, and focused on the audience’s needs…

After all, we’re in it together.

#### Summing It Up

Zenefits is:

- Bold: Keep the fluff out and the facts straight. Speak directly to issues and ideas, not around them.
- Personable: We’re not robots! The audience should always be able to tell someone’s on the other side of their screen.
- Optimistic: Everything for employers is changing, but we offer an exciting perspective because we love the
  opportunity that comes with this new world.
- Inclusive: Speak from perspective and empathize with your audience first and foremost. There are no right and wrong
  companies, just people working hard.

#### _It’s evocative, not provocative._

Don’t:

- Tell people how to be employers or employees: Every business has different needs for different reasons.
- Take credit for other’s success: We’re partners tackling HR, not in charge. Zenefits helps businesses grow, we don't
  cause it.
- Use inaccessible language: If it came from the backend or a legal document, it likely won’t belong in Zenefits. Keep
  it colloquial and don’t be condescending.
