DialogsManager is a pre-requisite for using multiple dialogs such as [Modal](#!/Modal). There's also a higher-order
component version called `withDialogs`.

#### Usage

```jsx static
withDialogs({ dialogsCount: 2 });
```

See [Modal](#!/Modal) for more details.

See [more examples](/app/stories/?selectedKind=overlays|ActionModal).
